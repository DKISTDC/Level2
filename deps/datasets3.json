For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”). In particular, we advocate for large raster maps with ViSP in polarimetric mode, using the CaII 854.2 nm line to investigate the chromospheric magnetic topology.

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”). In particular, we advocate for large raster maps with ViSP in polarimetric mode, using the CaII 854.2 nm line to investigate the chromospheric magnetic topology.

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”).

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”).

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun).

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”).

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun).

        "experimentDescription": "In early June 2022, Parker Solar Probe (PSP) conducts Encounter #12, with perihelion occurring at 2022-06-01/22:51 UTC (12:51 pm HST) at a distance of 13.3 Rsun and at an angle of -106 degrees relative to the Earth-Sun line (i.e. HEEG or HG-Stonyhurst longitude). For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”). In particular, we advocate for large raster maps with ViSP in polarimetric mode, using the CaII 854.2 nm line to investigate the chromospheric magnetic topology. Observations with DKIST should be conducted on June 2nd  and 3rd (if possible). ",

PJs were proposed to form from component (acute angle) reconnection of the magnetic field in spines with that in interspines and were proposed to contribute to transition-region and coronal heating above sunspots. In a recent investigation, it is proposed that penumbral jets form as a result of reconnection between the opposite polarity field at edges of filaments with spine field, and it is found that most of these jets do not significantly directly heat the corona above sunspots, but could indirectly drive coronal heating via generation of MHD waves or braiding of the magnetic field. However, there exist larger jets, repeatedly forming at tails of penumbral filaments, which directly display their signature in coronal wavelengths. Some of the larger penumbral jets are also found to show twisting motion. By using DKIST unprecedented resolution data we propose to investigate the formation mechanism of penumbral jets, and twisting in them. ",

Our recent detections of chromospheric intensity oscillations varying temporally and spatially before, during and after flares suggests a promising new line of investigation into flare energy deposition in the solar chromosphere, which we propose to develop with these DKIST observations. Oscillations or pulsations with periods around 3-minutes probe the mechanical, thermal and magnetic properties of the solar chromosphere, all of which can be strongly disrupted by the intense deposition of energy and momentum during a flare’s impulsive phase. With a combination of high-cadence VBI observations through narrowband filters (on which we will also test our new machine-learning techniques for atmospheric seeing corrections) and spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca II 8542 Å and Fe I 6302 Å lines we will investigate the oscillatory response of the chromosphere to a flare.",

PILs are special locations where non-potential magnetic energy is accumulated and eruptive magnetic structures are formed. However, it remains a mystery how such an energetic state is achieved. It has been proposed that it may be formed through flux cancellation due to shearing and converging motions in the photosphere, or mainly through the emergence of helical flux tubes already residing in the sub-photosphere. This proposal seeks to diagnose the vector magnetic field in multiple heights that covers the photosphere, chromosphere and upper chromosphere, in order to discern different models on the formation of energetic structures in active regions. The proposal requires the observation of an active region that is located close to the disk center within E30 to W30 and follow it for entire day hours for two consecutive days using ViSP, Cryo-NIRSP and VBI. The unprecedented spatial resolution of ~0.1 arcsec and multiple-height spectropolarimetry in FeI (630.2 nm), CaII (854.2 nm) and HeI (1083 nm) will provide unique data to address the issue of magnetic field structure along PILs.

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal is aimed to obtain advanced DKIST data to investigate the magnetic structure and plasma flows along and surrounding the PIL of an active region. PILs are special locations where non-potential magnetic energy is accumulated and eruptive magnetic structures are formed. However, it remains a mystery how such an energetic state is achieved. It has been proposed that it may be formed through flux cancellation due to shearing and converging motions in the photosphere, or mainly through the emergence of helical flux tubes already residing in the sub-photosphere. This proposal seeks to diagnose the vector magnetic field in multiple heights that covers the photosphere, chromosphere and upper chromosphere, in order to discern different models on the formation of energetic structures in active regions. The proposal requires the observation of an active region that is located close to the disk center within E30 to W30 and follow it for entire day hours for two consecutive days using ViSP, Cryo-NIRSP and VBI. The unprecedented spatial resolution of ~0.1 arcsec and multiple-height spectropolarimetry in FeI (630.2 nm), CaII (854.2 nm) and HeI (1083 nm) will provide unique data to address the issue of magnetic field structure along PILs. Further, this proposal and the analysis of the obtained data is a critical part of the dissertation of the PI which focuses on the study and understanding of the origin and evolution of solar eruptions. The DKIST data will play a major role in this study, through addressing the initial conditions of source regions.",

        "experimentDescription": "With this observational proposal we aim to determine the properties of the quiet Sun (QS) internetwork (IN) fields and their morphology as they transit from the photosphere to chromosphere. Recent observations show that these weak, small-scale fields continuously emerge, and per day, bring more magnetic flux to the solar surface than active regions. This promotes IN fields as the main driver of the QS magnetism. It is believed that IN fields may completely cover the QS photosphere, harboring a significant amount of magnetic energy. They are expected to have a crucial role in transferring this energy through the solar atmosphere. Because all of this, it is important to address the following questions: \n1) What is the magnetic flux budget in the IN?\n2) How the vector magnetic fields vary with height? \n3) How are the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields connected inside IN regions and what is their role in the energy transport? \nWe propose to address these questions using DKIST observations that will be compared with the latest Bifrost QS models with ~5 km spatial resolution. To achieve these goals, we need spectropolarimetric DKIST maps taken at high cadence of about 20 s, reaching a sensitivity of ~10^-4. With such sensitivity, DKIST is expected to show measurable circular, and more importantly, linear polarization signals which will make it possible to accurately characterize IN fields and their impact on the chromospheric dynamics and energetics.",

        "experimentDescription": "Near the boundary between penumbra and umbra, different magneto-convective modes are present. In penumbral filament heads (FH), upflows are observed that turn into the horizontal Evershed flow with increasing distance from the spot center and inclined magnetic fields are observed. In the umbra, however, magnetic fields are more vertical and stronger and convection is reduced. One exception are upflows observed in peripheral umbral dots (PUDs), that appear close to the penumbra/umbra boundary. Due to the limits in the spatial resolution of current solar telescopes, both PUDs and FHs could only just be resolved. With the outstanding spatial resolution of DKIST data, we want to study the substructure of PUDs and FHs. One aim is to investigate whether they are more elongated in larger sunspots, where the magnetic field at the penumbra/umbra boundary is more inclined. Another aim is to study the transition of a FH into a PUD. We want to follow the evolution of the magnetic field vector and velocity during this transition from one fundamental domain into the other and whether the vertical component of the magnetic field plays a major role. Additionally, we want to examine whether there is a response to this transition in atmospheric parameters of chromospheric layers. This could be similar to penumbra microjets, where magnetic reconnection is believed to either release mass flows or shock fronts.",

        "experimentDescription": "Granular lanes are believed to be the observational signature of underlying tubes of vortical flow with their axis oriented parallel to the solar surface. They consist of a dark lane preceded by a bright rim that move together from the boundary of a granule into the granule itself. We have recently found associated with these horizontal vortex tubes significant signal in linear polarisation, located at the trailing dark edge of the granular lane. We concluded, with the assistance of 3-D MHD simulations, that the vortical flows of granular lanes are capable of transporting magnetic flux to the solar surface within granules—a process termed as “shallow recirculation” by Rempel [2018ApJ...859..161R]. Supposedly, this mechanism is an important component of the small-scale dynamo acting at the solar surface and generating the quiet Sun magnetic field. We propose to undertake the first systematic study of granular lanes and their fine structure with high-cadence photospheric G-band images at unprecedented spatial resolution. Spectropolarimetric co-observations for part of the field-of-view will reveal the interaction of granular lanes with the magnetic field, enabling us to study details of the shallow recirculation process.",

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal aims at studying the role of electrical current dissipation in plage targets. \nIn plage regions, magnetic fields are expected to be highly concentrated in intergranular lanes in the photosphere. In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

Observed spectra will be compared with forward modeling from state-of-the-art simulations that include chromospheric physics and retrieved physical quantities will be compared to those in the simulation, to judge the realism of the modeling.

In penumbral filament heads (FH), upflows are observed that turn into the horizontal Evershed flow with increasing distance from the spot center and inclined magnetic fields are observed. In the umbra, however, magnetic fields are more vertical and stronger and convection is reduced. One exception are upflows observed in peripheral umbral dots (PUDs), that appear close to the penumbra/umbra boundary. Due to the limits in the spatial resolution of current solar telescopes, both PUDs and FHs could only just be resolved. With the outstanding spatial resolution of DKIST data, we want to study the substructure of PUDs and FHs. One aim is to investigate whether they are more elongated in larger sunspots, where the magnetic field at the penumbra/umbra boundary is more inclined. Another aim is to study the transition of a FH into a PUD. We want to follow the evolution of the magnetic field vector and velocity during this transition from one fundamental domain into the other and whether the vertical component of the magnetic field plays a major role. Additionally, we want to examine whether there is a response to this transition in atmospheric parameters of chromospheric layers. This could be similar to penumbra microjets, where magnetic reconnection is believed to either release mass flows or shock fronts.",

In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun). Like for previous PSP encounters and transits, a world-wide coordination of multiple observing facilities is being planned, with a campaign currently envisioned for the June 1-7, 2022 period. The current proposal requests Director’s Discretionary Time (DDT) to conduct DKIST on-disk observations in passive coordination with PSP during a portion of this period. The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”). In particular, we advocate for large raster maps with ViSP in polarimetric mode, using the CaII 854.2 nm line to investigate the chromospheric magnetic topology. Observations with DKIST should be conducted on June 2nd  and 3rd (if possible). ",

For several days afterwards, PSP will transit in front of the solar disk as viewed from Earth, while its distance from the Sun remains at less than ~0.25 AU (~60 Rsun).

The six remote sensing and four in situ instruments on board Solar Orbiter provide high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere and measure the plasma properties at the satellite. The Solar Orbiter observations allow for the study of the connection between the Sun and the heliosphere. On 13 October 2022, the Solar Orbiter will reach its perihelion 0.32 AU, and on 16 October, it will be in quadrature with Earth with respect to the Sun. As Solar Orbiter moves closer to the Sun-Earth line, we propose to co-observe a single active region with DKIST over multiple days. This will allow us to simultaneously collect some of the highest spatial resolution photospheric, chromospheric (both with the VBI at DKIST), and coronal (with the EUI onboard Solar Orbiter) imaging ever sampled. On top of this, high-resolution spectropolarimetric data sampled by the ViSP and the SPICE instruments will provide context about the local magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in exquisite detail. Such co-observations will return open-source datasets that will allow researchers to understand better the evolution of active regions (which are, of course, extremely important as the predominant locations where space weather events are driven from) and to probe the flows of mass and energy between different atmospheric layers in unprecedented detail. We propose that these datasets be sampled over 2-3 days, between the 22nd and 27th October 2022.",

The open polar fields channel most of the fast solar wind. Furthermore, the polar fields are believed to provide the seed field for the subsequent activity cycle. However, existing observations for either the photosphere or chromosphere do not have sufficient spatial resolution or spectro-polarimetric sensitivity to resolve the dominant facular-scale magnetic vector fields all the way to the pole. The unprecedented spatial resolution and spectro-polarimetric sensitivity of the full-Stokes photospheric and low- and high-chromospheric observations from ViSP would provide a map of reliable, properly-resolved facular magnetic field measurements, including many smaller, weaker structures for the first time. This detailed picture of how the polar fields penetrate the photospheric surface and expand through the chromosphere would have multiple consequences for our understanding of global solar magnetism, interior and atmospheric. We propose to take optimally weekly observations in the Fe I line at 630.2 nm (photosphere) and the Ca II line at 854.2 nm (chromosphere) around times of favorable viewing angle, construct synoptic polar maps from the data, trace newly-detected polar field through the atmospheric layers, and explore the heliospheric consequences of the measurements using standard modeling techniques and in situ data from 1AU as well as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.

        "experimentDescription": "The Sun's polar fields play a leading role in organizing the large-scale structure of the solar atmosphere and determining the interplanetary field strength. The open polar fields channel most of the fast solar wind. Furthermore, the polar fields are believed to provide the seed field for the subsequent activity cycle. However, existing observations for either the photosphere or chromosphere do not have sufficient spatial resolution or spectro-polarimetric sensitivity to resolve the dominant facular-scale magnetic vector fields all the way to the pole. The unprecedented spatial resolution and spectro-polarimetric sensitivity of the full-Stokes photospheric and low- and high-chromospheric observations from ViSP would provide a map of reliable, properly-resolved facular magnetic field measurements, including many smaller, weaker structures for the first time. This detailed picture of how the polar fields penetrate the photospheric surface and expand through the chromosphere would have multiple consequences for our understanding of global solar magnetism, interior and atmospheric. We propose to take optimally weekly observations in the Fe I line at 630.2 nm (photosphere) and the Ca II line at 854.2 nm (chromosphere) around times of favorable viewing angle, construct synoptic polar maps from the data, trace newly-detected polar field through the atmospheric layers, and explore the heliospheric consequences of the measurements using standard modeling techniques and in situ data from 1AU as well as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.  More exploratory, we would also search for polarization in Ca II H at 396.8 nm for signatures of the high-chromospheric field. ",

Ellerman bombs are a small-scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon observed in the lower solar atmosphere. Ellerman bombs appear both in the magnetically active solar regions as well as in quiet Sun. Recent observations suggest that Ellerman bombs are ubiquitous and nearly uniformly distributed throughout the solar surface; at a given time, as many as half a million Ellerman bombs could be present on the solar surface. In the second half of the last decade, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of Ellerman bombs thanks to the high-resolution observational facilities and state-of-the-art MHD simulations. However, there are several fundamental questions remain to be answered regarding the origin, formation, and magnetic field topology of Ellerman bombs. Given the ubiquitous nature, It will be of great interest to study the origin of quiet Sun Ellerman bombs and explore their role in chromospheric and coronal heating. With high spatial and spectral resolution observations with unprecedented polarimetric accuracy, 4m DKIST telescope will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of this smallest scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon in the lower solar atmosphere.",

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal aims at studying the role of electrical current dissipation in plage targets. \nIn plage regions, magnetic fields are expected to be highly concentrated in intergranular lanes in the photosphere. In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

        "experimentDescription": "For most dynamic and transient events in the solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection is the fundamental physical mechanism. Ellerman bombs are a small-scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon observed in the lower solar atmosphere. Ellerman bombs appear both in the magnetically active solar regions as well as in quiet Sun. Recent observations suggest that Ellerman bombs are ubiquitous and nearly uniformly distributed throughout the solar surface; at a given time, as many as half a million Ellerman bombs could be present on the solar surface. In the second half of the last decade, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of Ellerman bombs thanks to the high-resolution observational facilities and state-of-the-art MHD simulations. However, there are several fundamental questions remain to be answered regarding the origin, formation, and magnetic field topology of Ellerman bombs. Given the ubiquitous nature, It will be of great interest to study the origin of quiet Sun Ellerman bombs and explore their role in chromospheric and coronal heating. With high spatial and spectral resolution observations with unprecedented polarimetric accuracy, 4m DKIST telescope will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of this smallest scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon in the lower solar atmosphere.",

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP. At first, we will derive anti-parallel magnetic fields associated with magnetic reconnection at the root of the jets using the Stokes profiles of the Ca ll lines. Based on the magnetic configuration, we will interpret the H l Stokes profiles with the Zeeman effect, the Hanle effect, the Stark effect and electric Hanle effect (Casini 2005) and measure the reconnection electric field.",

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP. At first, we will derive anti-parallel magnetic fields associated with magnetic reconnection at the root of the jets using the Stokes profiles of the Ca ll lines. Based on the magnetic configuration, we will interpret the H l Stokes profiles with the Zeeman effect, the Hanle effect, the Stark effect and electric Hanle effect (Casini 2005) and measure the reconnection electric field.",

The scientific aim of these observations is that of investigating the magnetic environment of the “footpoints” of PSP during its passage on the solar disk. We propose to use both the ViSP and VBI to assess the dynamic and magnetic environment of the solar structures that give rise to the solar wind material experienced by PSP (“sub-solar-wind point”). In particular, we advocate for large raster maps with ViSP in polarimetric mode, using the CaII 854.2 nm line to investigate the chromospheric magnetic topology. Observations with DKIST should be conducted on June 2nd  and 3rd (if possible). ",

        "experimentDescription": "With this observational proposal we aim to determine the properties of the quiet Sun (QS) internetwork (IN) fields and their morphology as they transit from the photosphere to chromosphere. Recent observations show that these weak, small-scale fields continuously emerge, and per day, bring more magnetic flux to the solar surface than active regions. This promotes IN fields as the main driver of the QS magnetism. It is believed that IN fields may completely cover the QS photosphere, harboring a significant amount of magnetic energy. They are expected to have a crucial role in transferring this energy through the solar atmosphere. Because all of this, it is important to address the following questions: \n1) What is the magnetic flux budget in the IN?\n2) How the vector magnetic fields vary with height? \n3) How are the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields connected inside IN regions and what is their role in the energy transport? \nWe propose to address these questions using DKIST observations that will be compared with the latest Bifrost QS models with ~5 km spatial resolution. To achieve these goals, we need spectropolarimetric DKIST maps taken at high cadence of about 20 s, reaching a sensitivity of ~10^-4. With such sensitivity, DKIST is expected to show measurable circular, and more importantly, linear polarization signals which will make it possible to accurately characterize IN fields and their impact on the chromospheric dynamics and energetics.",

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry. Finally we intend to compare our (photospheric) results with three-dimensional  radiative MHD simulations of a sunspot.",

In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry.

        "experimentDescription": "With this observational proposal we aim to determine the properties of the quiet Sun (QS) internetwork (IN) fields and their morphology as they transit from the photosphere to chromosphere. Recent observations show that these weak, small-scale fields continuously emerge, and per day, bring more magnetic flux to the solar surface than active regions. This promotes IN fields as the main driver of the QS magnetism. It is believed that IN fields may completely cover the QS photosphere, harboring a significant amount of magnetic energy. They are expected to have a crucial role in transferring this energy through the solar atmosphere. Because all of this, it is important to address the following questions: \n1) What is the magnetic flux budget in the IN?\n2) How the vector magnetic fields vary with height? \n3) How are the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields connected inside IN regions and what is their role in the energy transport? \nWe propose to address these questions using DKIST observations that will be compared with the latest Bifrost QS models with ~5 km spatial resolution. To achieve these goals, we need spectropolarimetric DKIST maps taken at high cadence of about 20 s, reaching a sensitivity of ~10^-4. With such sensitivity, DKIST is expected to show measurable circular, and more importantly, linear polarization signals which will make it possible to accurately characterize IN fields and their impact on the chromospheric dynamics and energetics.",

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry. Finally we intend to compare our (photospheric) results with three-dimensional  radiative MHD simulations of a sunspot.",

        "experimentDescription": "With this observational proposal we aim to determine the properties of the quiet Sun (QS) internetwork (IN) fields and their morphology as they transit from the photosphere to chromosphere. Recent observations show that these weak, small-scale fields continuously emerge, and per day, bring more magnetic flux to the solar surface than active regions. This promotes IN fields as the main driver of the QS magnetism. It is believed that IN fields may completely cover the QS photosphere, harboring a significant amount of magnetic energy. They are expected to have a crucial role in transferring this energy through the solar atmosphere. Because all of this, it is important to address the following questions: \n1) What is the magnetic flux budget in the IN?\n2) How the vector magnetic fields vary with height? \n3) How are the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields connected inside IN regions and what is their role in the energy transport? \nWe propose to address these questions using DKIST observations that will be compared with the latest Bifrost QS models with ~5 km spatial resolution. To achieve these goals, we need spectropolarimetric DKIST maps taken at high cadence of about 20 s, reaching a sensitivity of ~10^-4. With such sensitivity, DKIST is expected to show measurable circular, and more importantly, linear polarization signals which will make it possible to accurately characterize IN fields and their impact on the chromospheric dynamics and energetics.",

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry. Finally we intend to compare our (photospheric) results with three-dimensional  radiative MHD simulations of a sunspot.",

Recent observations show that these weak, small-scale fields continuously emerge, and per day, bring more magnetic flux to the solar surface than active regions. This promotes IN fields as the main driver of the QS magnetism. It is believed that IN fields may completely cover the QS photosphere, harboring a significant amount of magnetic energy. They are expected to have a crucial role in transferring this energy through the solar atmosphere. Because all of this, it is important to address the following questions: \n1) What is the magnetic flux budget in the IN?\n2) How the vector magnetic fields vary with height? \n3) How are the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields connected inside IN regions and what is their role in the energy transport? \nWe propose to address these questions using DKIST observations that will be compared with the latest Bifrost QS models with ~5 km spatial resolution. To achieve these goals, we need spectropolarimetric DKIST maps taken at high cadence of about 20 s, reaching a sensitivity of ~10^-4. With such sensitivity, DKIST is expected to show measurable circular, and more importantly, linear polarization signals which will make it possible to accurately characterize IN fields and their impact on the chromospheric dynamics and energetics.",

High-cadence imaging with VBI will be used to identify the white-light kernels and to compare/contrast the evolution and structure of the kernels at an unprecedented spatial resolution.  We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.  Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  The ViSP polarimetry of the continuum near Fe I will be used in a novel search for nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a population of ultra-relativistic electrons.  \n",

While the vertical component of the photospheric magnetic field, which is relatively strong, has been studied extensively, the relatively weaker small-scale transverse field warrants more thorough investigation. The Zeeman effect is often blind as a diagnostic to mixed-polarity fields within the resolution limit, necessitating the highest spatial resolution.

This proposal is concerned with using the unprecedented resolution of the DKIST to unlock our understanding of the turbulent, small-scale magnetic field in the photosphere. We intend to evaluate the strength, inclination and typical filling factors of the magnetic field, in the photosphere with the magnetically sensitive Fe I 630.15/630.2 nm line pair, and anticipate this to be possible for a large proportion of the field of view at ViSP resolution and sensitivity.

        "experimentDescription": "With this observational proposal we aim to determine the properties of the quiet Sun (QS) internetwork (IN) fields and their morphology as they transit from the photosphere to chromosphere. Recent observations show that these weak, small-scale fields continuously emerge, and per day, bring more magnetic flux to the solar surface than active regions. This promotes IN fields as the main driver of the QS magnetism. It is believed that IN fields may completely cover the QS photosphere, harboring a significant amount of magnetic energy. They are expected to have a crucial role in transferring this energy through the solar atmosphere. Because all of this, it is important to address the following questions: \n1) What is the magnetic flux budget in the IN?\n2) How the vector magnetic fields vary with height? \n3) How are the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields connected inside IN regions and what is their role in the energy transport? \nWe propose to address these questions using DKIST observations that will be compared with the latest Bifrost QS models with ~5 km spatial resolution. To achieve these goals, we need spectropolarimetric DKIST maps taken at high cadence of about 20 s, reaching a sensitivity of ~10^-4. With such sensitivity, DKIST is expected to show measurable circular, and more importantly, linear polarization signals which will make it possible to accurately characterize IN fields and their impact on the chromospheric dynamics and energetics.",

        "experimentDescription": "Small-scale flows driven by turbulent convection are critical in creating fine magnetic structures through a local dynamo mechanism as well as in generation and injection of Poynting flux into the upper atmosphere. It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry. Finally we intend to compare our (photospheric) results with three-dimensional  radiative MHD simulations of a sunspot.",

However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved.",

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal aims at studying the role of electrical current dissipation in plage targets. \nIn plage regions, magnetic fields are expected to be highly concentrated in intergranular lanes in the photosphere. In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry. Finally we intend to compare our (photospheric) results with three-dimensional  radiative MHD simulations of a sunspot.",

        "experimentDescription": "Small-scale flows driven by turbulent convection are critical in creating fine magnetic structures through a local dynamo mechanism as well as in generation and injection of Poynting flux into the upper atmosphere. It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

We will employ non-LTE inversions with the STiC code to determine temperature, velocity, and magnetic field in spicules. This will allow us to characterize waves and their propagation in spicules and explore the possibility to detect Alfvenic waves in the Stokes V signal. We will compare the observations with synthetic observables calculated from advanced radiative MHD  models of spicules. The DKIST observations will allow a major advancement in the characterization of spicules and will pose strict constraints on models.

However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved.",

        "experimentDescription": "Jet phenomena with a bright loop in their footpoint, called anemone jets, have been observed in the solar corona and chromosphere. These jets are formed as a consequence of magnetic reconnection, and from the scale universality of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), it can be expected that anemone jets exist even in the solar photosphere. Kotani & Shibata (2020) performed 3D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection with solar photospheric parameters and showed that jet-like structures were induced by reconnection in the solar photosphere. We also pointed out that MHD waves generated by photospheric anemone jet-like structures could influence the local chromospheric heating and the formation of spicules. However, our numerical simulations did not reveal the statistical nature of the photospheric anemone jet-like structure, as the simulations were performed given typical and expected parameters. We propose to detect the anemone jet-like structures with their length of approximately 100 km in the photosphere for the first time and to investigate their statistical properties and their effects on chromospheric heating and spicule formation through the high-resolution DKIST observations of photosphere and chromosphere.",

        "experimentDescription": "Recent studies have observed a plethora of MHD wave phenomena in magnetic features of varying scales in the solar atmosphere. However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved.",

These jets are formed as a consequence of magnetic reconnection, and from the scale universality of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), it can be expected that anemone jets exist even in the solar photosphere. Kotani & Shibata (2020) performed 3D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection with solar photospheric parameters and showed that jet-like structures were induced by reconnection in the solar photosphere. We also pointed out that MHD waves generated by photospheric anemone jet-like structures could influence the local chromospheric heating and the formation of spicules. However, our numerical simulations did not reveal the statistical nature of the photospheric anemone jet-like structure, as the simulations were performed given typical and expected parameters. We propose to detect the anemone jet-like structures with their length of approximately 100 km in the photosphere for the first time and to investigate their statistical properties and their effects on chromospheric heating and spicule formation through the high-resolution DKIST observations of photosphere and chromosphere.",

We will utilize observations acquired with the DKIST to investigate the contribution of these small-size magnetic elements to the radiative emission at different spectral ranges. By spatially degrading our observations to mimic the spatial resolution of full-disk images typically employed for irradiance variation studies,  we will evaluate the impact of such ‘hidden’ fields to estimates of solar irradiance variability. Our results will be used to compare and validate the use of 3D MHD simulations in the study of spectral irradiance variability.  Comparisons between the observed and simulated solar atmospheres obtained with two different MHD codes will be undertaken. \n",

        "experimentDescription": "The magnetic field of the solar surface has a huge influence on solar phenomena, and thus developing our understanding of this field on the smallest scales is a crucial science goal. While the vertical component of the photospheric magnetic field, which is relatively strong, has been studied extensively, the relatively weaker small-scale transverse field warrants more thorough investigation. The Zeeman effect is often blind as a diagnostic to mixed-polarity fields within the resolution limit, necessitating the highest spatial resolution. At the same time, the weak polarization signals produced by such small-scale fields are some of the weakest observable on the Sun. This proposal is concerned with using the unprecedented resolution of the DKIST to unlock our understanding of the turbulent, small-scale magnetic field in the photosphere. We intend to evaluate the strength, inclination and typical filling factors of the magnetic field, in the photosphere with the magnetically sensitive Fe I 630.15/630.2 nm line pair, and anticipate this to be possible for a large proportion of the field of view at ViSP resolution and sensitivity. Additional thermodynamic and kinematic quantities describing the atmosphere (i.e. temperature, velocities) will be derived from inversions. From deep-mode or \"sit-and-stare\" observations, we will additionally be able to observe the dynamics of all of these quantities. ",

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP. At first, we will derive anti-parallel magnetic fields associated with magnetic reconnection at the root of the jets using the Stokes profiles of the Ca ll lines. Based on the magnetic configuration, we will interpret the H l Stokes profiles with the Zeeman effect, the Hanle effect, the Stark effect and electric Hanle effect (Casini 2005) and measure the reconnection electric field.",

        "experimentDescription": "Small-scale flows driven by turbulent convection are critical in creating fine magnetic structures through a local dynamo mechanism as well as in generation and injection of Poynting flux into the upper atmosphere. It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

We will employ non-LTE inversions with the STiC code to determine temperature, velocity, and magnetic field in spicules. This will allow us to characterize waves and their propagation in spicules and explore the possibility to detect Alfvenic waves in the Stokes V signal. We will compare the observations with synthetic observables calculated from advanced radiative MHD  models of spicules. The DKIST observations will allow a major advancement in the characterization of spicules and will pose strict constraints on models. This will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation and heating of these chromospheric features, the role of magnetic waves in their dynamic evolution, and get a better insight in their full impact on the mass and energy balance of the outer solar atmosphere.

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP. At first, we will derive anti-parallel magnetic fields associated with magnetic reconnection at the root of the jets using the Stokes profiles of the Ca ll lines. Based on the magnetic configuration, we will interpret the H l Stokes profiles with the Zeeman effect, the Hanle effect, the Stark effect and electric Hanle effect (Casini 2005) and measure the reconnection electric field.",

        "experimentDescription": "The magnetic field of the solar surface has a huge influence on solar phenomena, and thus developing our understanding of this field on the smallest scales is a crucial science goal. While the vertical component of the photospheric magnetic field, which is relatively strong, has been studied extensively, the relatively weaker small-scale transverse field warrants more thorough investigation. The Zeeman effect is often blind as a diagnostic to mixed-polarity fields within the resolution limit, necessitating the highest spatial resolution. At the same time, the weak polarization signals produced by such small-scale fields are some of the weakest observable on the Sun. This proposal is concerned with using the unprecedented resolution of the DKIST to unlock our understanding of the turbulent, small-scale magnetic field in the photosphere. We intend to evaluate the strength, inclination and typical filling factors of the magnetic field, in the photosphere with the magnetically sensitive Fe I 630.15/630.2 nm line pair, and anticipate this to be possible for a large proportion of the field of view at ViSP resolution and sensitivity. Additional thermodynamic and kinematic quantities describing the atmosphere (i.e. temperature, velocities) will be derived from inversions. From deep-mode or \"sit-and-stare\" observations, we will additionally be able to observe the dynamics of all of these quantities. ",

We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.  Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.

        "experimentDescription": "Small-scale flows driven by turbulent convection are critical in creating fine magnetic structures through a local dynamo mechanism as well as in generation and injection of Poynting flux into the upper atmosphere. It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

We will employ non-LTE inversions with the STiC code to determine temperature, velocity, and magnetic field in spicules. This will allow us to characterize waves and their propagation in spicules and explore the possibility to detect Alfvenic waves in the Stokes V signal. We will compare the observations with synthetic observables calculated from advanced radiative MHD  models of spicules. The DKIST observations will allow a major advancement in the characterization of spicules and will pose strict constraints on models. This will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation and heating of these chromospheric features, the role of magnetic waves in their dynamic evolution, and get a better insight in their full impact on the mass and energy balance of the outer solar atmosphere.

In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved.",

        "experimentDescription": "Recent studies have observed a plethora of MHD wave phenomena in magnetic features of varying scales in the solar atmosphere. However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved.",

High-cadence imaging with VBI will be used to identify the white-light kernels and to compare/contrast the evolution and structure of the kernels at an unprecedented spatial resolution.  We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.

        "experimentDescription": "Small-scale flows driven by turbulent convection are critical in creating fine magnetic structures through a local dynamo mechanism as well as in generation and injection of Poynting flux into the upper atmosphere. It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

        "experimentDescription": "Recent studies have observed a plethora of MHD wave phenomena in magnetic features of varying scales in the solar atmosphere. However, the identification of such waves in the lower solar atmosphere is a complex problem because the various eigenmodes available in the MHD Hilbert space have overlapping properties. This has limited studies to low order modes. One aspect of MHD wave modes that has only been identified in observations very recently, is the spatial characteristics of the mode across the flux tube [1]. This is a key component in understanding energy transfer from the waveguide to the quiescent environment and therefore represents a crucial step in the contribution of the various wave modes to heating the solar atmosphere. As such, this proposal is commensurate with the DKIST science objectives with respect to wave generation and heating in the atmosphere. By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere. This will allow us to ascertain the importance of magnetic bright points in energy transfer within the quiet Sun as well as the mechanisms involved.",

        "experimentDescription": "Small-scale flows driven by turbulent convection are critical in creating fine magnetic structures through a local dynamo mechanism as well as in generation and injection of Poynting flux into the upper atmosphere. It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

In penumbral filament heads (FH), upflows are observed that turn into the horizontal Evershed flow with increasing distance from the spot center and inclined magnetic fields are observed. In the umbra, however, magnetic fields are more vertical and stronger and convection is reduced. One exception are upflows observed in peripheral umbral dots (PUDs), that appear close to the penumbra/umbra boundary. Due to the limits in the spatial resolution of current solar telescopes, both PUDs and FHs could only just be resolved. With the outstanding spatial resolution of DKIST data, we want to study the substructure of PUDs and FHs. One aim is to investigate whether they are more elongated in larger sunspots, where the magnetic field at the penumbra/umbra boundary is more inclined. Another aim is to study the transition of a FH into a PUD. We want to follow the evolution of the magnetic field vector and velocity during this transition from one fundamental domain into the other and whether the vertical component of the magnetic field plays a major role. Additionally, we want to examine whether there is a response to this transition in atmospheric parameters of chromospheric layers. This could be similar to penumbra microjets, where magnetic reconnection is believed to either release mass flows or shock fronts.",

        "experimentDescription": "Sunspot penumbral jets are dynamic small scale events, seen in the chromosphere. Penumbral jets are ubiquitous. Their formation mechanism is not fully understood. PJs were proposed to form from component (acute angle) reconnection of the magnetic field in spines with that in interspines and were proposed to contribute to transition-region and coronal heating above sunspots. In a recent investigation, it is proposed that penumbral jets form as a result of reconnection between the opposite polarity field at edges of filaments with spine field, and it is found that most of these jets do not significantly directly heat the corona above sunspots, but could indirectly drive coronal heating via generation of MHD waves or braiding of the magnetic field. However, there exist larger jets, repeatedly forming at tails of penumbral filaments, which directly display their signature in coronal wavelengths. Some of the larger penumbral jets are also found to show twisting motion. By using DKIST unprecedented resolution data we propose to investigate the formation mechanism of penumbral jets, and twisting in them. ",

        "experimentDescription": "Solar Orbiter is an ESA/NASA's Sun orbiting mission that was launched in February 2020. The nominal science phase of the mission started in November 2021. The six remote sensing and four in situ instruments on board Solar Orbiter provide high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere and measure the plasma properties at the satellite. The Solar Orbiter observations allow for the study of the connection between the Sun and the heliosphere. On 13 October 2022, the Solar Orbiter will reach its perihelion 0.32 AU, and on 16 October, it will be in quadrature with Earth with respect to the Sun. As Solar Orbiter moves closer to the Sun-Earth line, we propose to co-observe a single active region with DKIST over multiple days. This will allow us to simultaneously collect some of the highest spatial resolution photospheric, chromospheric (both with the VBI at DKIST), and coronal (with the EUI onboard Solar Orbiter) imaging ever sampled. On top of this, high-resolution spectropolarimetric data sampled by the ViSP and the SPICE instruments will provide context about the local magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in exquisite detail. Such co-observations will return open-source datasets that will allow researchers to understand better the evolution of active regions (which are, of course, extremely important as the predominant locations where space weather events are driven from) and to probe the flows of mass and energy between different atmospheric layers in unprecedented detail. We propose that these datasets be sampled over 2-3 days, between the 22nd and 27th October 2022.",

        "experimentDescription": "Granular lanes are believed to be the observational signature of underlying tubes of vortical flow with their axis oriented parallel to the solar surface. They consist of a dark lane preceded by a bright rim that move together from the boundary of a granule into the granule itself. We have recently found associated with these horizontal vortex tubes significant signal in linear polarisation, located at the trailing dark edge of the granular lane. We concluded, with the assistance of 3-D MHD simulations, that the vortical flows of granular lanes are capable of transporting magnetic flux to the solar surface within granules—a process termed as “shallow recirculation” by Rempel [2018ApJ...859..161R]. Supposedly, this mechanism is an important component of the small-scale dynamo acting at the solar surface and generating the quiet Sun magnetic field. We propose to undertake the first systematic study of granular lanes and their fine structure with high-cadence photospheric G-band images at unprecedented spatial resolution. Spectropolarimetric co-observations for part of the field-of-view will reveal the interaction of granular lanes with the magnetic field, enabling us to study details of the shallow recirculation process.",

Our recent detections of chromospheric intensity oscillations varying temporally and spatially before, during and after flares suggests a promising new line of investigation into flare energy deposition in the solar chromosphere, which we propose to develop with these DKIST observations. Oscillations or pulsations with periods around 3-minutes probe the mechanical, thermal and magnetic properties of the solar chromosphere, all of which can be strongly disrupted by the intense deposition of energy and momentum during a flare’s impulsive phase. With a combination of high-cadence VBI observations through narrowband filters (on which we will also test our new machine-learning techniques for atmospheric seeing corrections) and spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca II 8542 Å and Fe I 6302 Å lines we will investigate the oscillatory response of the chromosphere to a flare.",

        "experimentDescription": "The impact of a flare on the solar chromosphere can be detected in various ways - primarily the radiation signatures but also mechanical perturbations – pulsations or oscillations – and changes to the chromospheric magnetic field. Our recent detections of chromospheric intensity oscillations varying temporally and spatially before, during and after flares suggests a promising new line of investigation into flare energy deposition in the solar chromosphere, which we propose to develop with these DKIST observations. Oscillations or pulsations with periods around 3-minutes probe the mechanical, thermal and magnetic properties of the solar chromosphere, all of which can be strongly disrupted by the intense deposition of energy and momentum during a flare’s impulsive phase. With a combination of high-cadence VBI observations through narrowband filters (on which we will also test our new machine-learning techniques for atmospheric seeing corrections) and spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca II 8542 Å and Fe I 6302 Å lines we will investigate the oscillatory response of the chromosphere to a flare.",

It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

The photospheric Evershed flow and its inverse counterpart are the most conspicuous and vigorous flow pattern observed in and above sunspot penumbrae but the (magnetized) structures hosting the flows remain spatially unresolved in contemporary observations. The DKIST will allow us to obtain spectropolarimetric and imaging observations of unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. Those observations are expected to resolve the penumbral and super-penumbral fine structure in intensity and polarization to the extent necessary for significantly advancing our understanding of the structures harboring the flows. We will apply standard spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric data analysis techniques to establish relationships between different physical parameters and the spatial scales they are detected on. This will be complemented by the use of inversion techniques to deduce the magnetic field and its geometry. Finally we intend to compare our (photospheric) results with three-dimensional  radiative MHD simulations of a sunspot.",

It is expected that turbulent cascade creates significant power in the flow fields smaller than 100 km. The unpreceded spatial resolution achieved with DKIST allows us to examine velocity and magnetic fields at that spatial scales for the first time. It is also possible that there are significant contributions of unresolved flows, such as micro-turbulence and LOS velocity gradients, even with the DKIST resolution. The most powerful approach to diagnose micro-turbulence and the LOS velocity gradient is to use spectral line profiles, especially line broadening and asymmetry, which contain information on the flow fields smaller than the spatial resolution. Using the Hinode spectro-polarimeter, we found that small-scale enhancements of line broadening often happened in a fading phase of granules (Ishikawa et al. 2020) although it has not been clarified yet why the line broadening is enhanced. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed observation is to reveal the origin of the spectral line broadening by investigating small-scale flow fields and their association with magnetic fields. To achieve this, we will obtain spectro-polarimetric profiles of the Fe I 630 nm and Ca II 854 nm lines with ViSP to get micro-turbulence, LOS velocity gradients, and magnetic fields in the photosphere and the chromosphere together with horizontal velocities inferred from a time series of blue-continuum images taken with VBI-B.",

This proposal seeks to diagnose the vector magnetic field in multiple heights that covers the photosphere, chromosphere and upper chromosphere, in order to discern different models on the formation of energetic structures in active regions. The proposal requires the observation of an active region that is located close to the disk center within E30 to W30 and follow it for entire day hours for two consecutive days using ViSP, Cryo-NIRSP and VBI. The unprecedented spatial resolution of ~0.1 arcsec and multiple-height spectropolarimetry in FeI (630.2 nm), CaII (854.2 nm) and HeI (1083 nm) will provide unique data to address the issue of magnetic field structure along PILs. Further, this proposal and the analysis of the obtained data is a critical part of the dissertation of the PI which focuses on the study and understanding of the origin and evolution of solar eruptions. The DKIST data will play a major role in this study, through addressing the initial conditions of source regions.",

By availing of the high-resolution observations and spectropolarimetry made possible with DKIST, our proposal aims to gain new insights into the surface and body characteristics of wave modes in the smallest of magnetic structures (i.e, magnetic bright points) at multiple heights in the solar atmosphere.

The unprecedented spatial resolution and spectro-polarimetric sensitivity of the full-Stokes photospheric and low- and high-chromospheric observations from ViSP would provide a map of reliable, properly-resolved facular magnetic field measurements, including many smaller, weaker structures for the first time. This detailed picture of how the polar fields penetrate the photospheric surface and expand through the chromosphere would have multiple consequences for our understanding of global solar magnetism, interior and atmospheric. We propose to take optimally weekly observations in the Fe I line at 630.2 nm (photosphere) and the Ca II line at 854.2 nm (chromosphere) around times of favorable viewing angle, construct synoptic polar maps from the data, trace newly-detected polar field through the atmospheric layers, and explore the heliospheric consequences of the measurements using standard modeling techniques and in situ data from 1AU as well as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal aims at studying the role of electrical current dissipation in plage targets. \nIn plage regions, magnetic fields are expected to be highly concentrated in intergranular lanes in the photosphere. In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP.

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP.

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal aims at studying the role of electrical current dissipation in plage targets. \nIn plage regions, magnetic fields are expected to be highly concentrated in intergranular lanes in the photosphere. In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

        "experimentDescription": "The Sun's polar fields play a leading role in organizing the large-scale structure of the solar atmosphere and determining the interplanetary field strength. The open polar fields channel most of the fast solar wind. Furthermore, the polar fields are believed to provide the seed field for the subsequent activity cycle. However, existing observations for either the photosphere or chromosphere do not have sufficient spatial resolution or spectro-polarimetric sensitivity to resolve the dominant facular-scale magnetic vector fields all the way to the pole. The unprecedented spatial resolution and spectro-polarimetric sensitivity of the full-Stokes photospheric and low- and high-chromospheric observations from ViSP would provide a map of reliable, properly-resolved facular magnetic field measurements, including many smaller, weaker structures for the first time. This detailed picture of how the polar fields penetrate the photospheric surface and expand through the chromosphere would have multiple consequences for our understanding of global solar magnetism, interior and atmospheric. We propose to take optimally weekly observations in the Fe I line at 630.2 nm (photosphere) and the Ca II line at 854.2 nm (chromosphere) around times of favorable viewing angle, construct synoptic polar maps from the data, trace newly-detected polar field through the atmospheric layers, and explore the heliospheric consequences of the measurements using standard modeling techniques and in situ data from 1AU as well as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.  More exploratory, we would also search for polarization in Ca II H at 396.8 nm for signatures of the high-chromospheric field. ",

We will acquire ViSP Ca II 854.2 nm spectra from a fast (7s) cadence, sparse (3-step) raster that crosses disk spicules at different heights. VBI Hbeta and Ca II K imaging will serve as a reference. We will employ non-LTE inversions with the STiC code to determine temperature, velocity, and magnetic field in spicules. This will allow us to characterize waves and their propagation in spicules and explore the possibility to detect Alfvenic waves in the Stokes V signal. We will compare the observations with synthetic observables calculated from advanced radiative MHD  models of spicules. The DKIST observations will allow a major advancement in the characterization of spicules and will pose strict constraints on models. This will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation and heating of these chromospheric features, the role of magnetic waves in their dynamic evolution, and get a better insight in their full impact on the mass and energy balance of the outer solar atmosphere.

        "experimentDescription": "This proposal aims at studying the role of electrical current dissipation in plage targets. \nIn plage regions, magnetic fields are expected to be highly concentrated in intergranular lanes in the photosphere. In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

        "experimentDescription": "Sunspots play an outstanding role in astrophysical research, since they provide a direct observation of the energy transport in magnetized plasma, at all their characteristic scales, and in different magnetic environments: strong vertical fields in umbra, weaker more horizontal fields in penumbra. In this research project, we address the penumbral mode of radiative magnetoconvection. We want to infer the physical fine-structure of a penumbral filament as it forms and evolves in a sunspot. As it is known that a penumbra harbors two field 'components', one that is more vertical ('spines') and one that is more horizontal ('intra-spines'), we aim to investigate the interplay between these two components as a magnetoconvective cell, which constitutes a filament, evolves. We aim to infer the time-dependent topology of the magnetic field, as well as the flow field. Magnetic reconnection, previously observed as chromospheric micro-jets, could be a process that is relevant during the filament evolution.\n\nOur observing program consists of a time series of ViSP scans with a time cadence of less than 3 minutes, in which the slit is aligned to the filaments. ViSP records 3 spectral regions simultaneously. VBI Blue imaging in the blue continuum will allow to study the small-scale evolution of the filaments.\n\nWe will analyze the data with sophisticated inversion techniques and compare our results with synthetic maps of corresponding numerical simulations.\n",

We will employ non-LTE inversions with the STiC code to determine temperature, velocity, and magnetic field in spicules. This will allow us to characterize waves and their propagation in spicules and explore the possibility to detect Alfvenic waves in the Stokes V signal. We will compare the observations with synthetic observables calculated from advanced radiative MHD  models of spicules. The DKIST observations will allow a major advancement in the characterization of spicules and will pose strict constraints on models. This will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the formation and heating of these chromospheric features, the role of magnetic waves in their dynamic evolution, and get a better insight in their full impact on the mass and energy balance of the outer solar atmosphere.

We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP. At first, we will derive anti-parallel magnetic fields associated with magnetic reconnection at the root of the jets using the Stokes profiles of the Ca ll lines.

The spectro-polarimeters of the DKIST, in principle, allow us to do the first measurement of an electric field associated with chromospheric reconnection, which drives chromospheric jets, provided plasmoids or turbulence enlarge the spatial scale of the magnetic diffusion region, which has been suggested in models. We request observing time to obtain Stokes profiles of chromospheric jets in Ca ll lines and H l 397 nm using ViSP while also obtaining context images using VBI-Blue. The H l line is near the Ca ll H line and within the same spectral window of the ViSP. At first, we will derive anti-parallel magnetic fields associated with magnetic reconnection at the root of the jets using the Stokes profiles of the Ca ll lines. Based on the magnetic configuration, we will interpret the H l Stokes profiles with the Zeeman effect, the Hanle effect, the Stark effect and electric Hanle effect (Casini 2005) and measure the reconnection electric field.",

        "experimentDescription": "For most dynamic and transient events in the solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection is the fundamental physical mechanism. Ellerman bombs are a small-scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon observed in the lower solar atmosphere. Ellerman bombs appear both in the magnetically active solar regions as well as in quiet Sun. Recent observations suggest that Ellerman bombs are ubiquitous and nearly uniformly distributed throughout the solar surface; at a given time, as many as half a million Ellerman bombs could be present on the solar surface. In the second half of the last decade, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of Ellerman bombs thanks to the high-resolution observational facilities and state-of-the-art MHD simulations. However, there are several fundamental questions remain to be answered regarding the origin, formation, and magnetic field topology of Ellerman bombs. Given the ubiquitous nature, It will be of great interest to study the origin of quiet Sun Ellerman bombs and explore their role in chromospheric and coronal heating. With high spatial and spectral resolution observations with unprecedented polarimetric accuracy, 4m DKIST telescope will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of this smallest scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon in the lower solar atmosphere.",

In the chromosphere gas pressure decreases with height much more rapidly than magnetic pressure and therefore the magnetic fields form a hot canopy above the photosphere.\n\nIn the chromosphere of plage regions, enhanced radiative cooling (brightness) is detected in observations acquired in optically thick lines of H I, Mg II and Ca II. Although the exact mechanisms that transport and dissipate that energy in the chromosphere are not yet known, many theoretical models have been proposed. \n\nOur goal is to study how the presence and dissipation of electrical currents in the lower boundary of the magnetic canopy contributes to the heating of plage chromospheres. To do so, we propose to use new DKIST full-Stokes observations in spectral lines that sample the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere (Fe I 6301/6302, Ca II 8542, Ca II H) with an unprecedented S/N to derive the stratification of the magnetic field vector. We will use a new spatially-coupled version of the STiC inversion code that also allows including spatial degradation effects and regularization.\n",

In this research project, we address the penumbral mode of radiative magnetoconvection. We want to infer the physical fine-structure of a penumbral filament as it forms and evolves in a sunspot. As it is known that a penumbra harbors two field 'components', one that is more vertical ('spines') and one that is more horizontal ('intra-spines'), we aim to investigate the interplay between these two components as a magnetoconvective cell, which constitutes a filament, evolves. We aim to infer the time-dependent topology of the magnetic field, as well as the flow field. Magnetic reconnection, previously observed as chromospheric micro-jets, could be a process that is relevant during the filament evolution.\n\nOur observing program consists of a time series of ViSP scans with a time cadence of less than 3 minutes, in which the slit is aligned to the filaments. ViSP records 3 spectral regions simultaneously. VBI Blue imaging in the blue continuum will allow to study the small-scale evolution of the filaments.\n\nWe will analyze the data with sophisticated inversion techniques and compare our results with synthetic maps of corresponding numerical simulations.\n",

        "experimentDescription": "The Sun's polar fields play a leading role in organizing the large-scale structure of the solar atmosphere and determining the interplanetary field strength. The open polar fields channel most of the fast solar wind. Furthermore, the polar fields are believed to provide the seed field for the subsequent activity cycle. However, existing observations for either the photosphere or chromosphere do not have sufficient spatial resolution or spectro-polarimetric sensitivity to resolve the dominant facular-scale magnetic vector fields all the way to the pole. The unprecedented spatial resolution and spectro-polarimetric sensitivity of the full-Stokes photospheric and low- and high-chromospheric observations from ViSP would provide a map of reliable, properly-resolved facular magnetic field measurements, including many smaller, weaker structures for the first time. This detailed picture of how the polar fields penetrate the photospheric surface and expand through the chromosphere would have multiple consequences for our understanding of global solar magnetism, interior and atmospheric. We propose to take optimally weekly observations in the Fe I line at 630.2 nm (photosphere) and the Ca II line at 854.2 nm (chromosphere) around times of favorable viewing angle, construct synoptic polar maps from the data, trace newly-detected polar field through the atmospheric layers, and explore the heliospheric consequences of the measurements using standard modeling techniques and in situ data from 1AU as well as Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.  More exploratory, we would also search for polarization in Ca II H at 396.8 nm for signatures of the high-chromospheric field. ",

        "experimentDescription": "For most dynamic and transient events in the solar atmosphere, magnetic reconnection is the fundamental physical mechanism. Ellerman bombs are a small-scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon observed in the lower solar atmosphere. Ellerman bombs appear both in the magnetically active solar regions as well as in quiet Sun. Recent observations suggest that Ellerman bombs are ubiquitous and nearly uniformly distributed throughout the solar surface; at a given time, as many as half a million Ellerman bombs could be present on the solar surface. In the second half of the last decade, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of Ellerman bombs thanks to the high-resolution observational facilities and state-of-the-art MHD simulations. However, there are several fundamental questions remain to be answered regarding the origin, formation, and magnetic field topology of Ellerman bombs. Given the ubiquitous nature, It will be of great interest to study the origin of quiet Sun Ellerman bombs and explore their role in chromospheric and coronal heating. With high spatial and spectral resolution observations with unprecedented polarimetric accuracy, 4m DKIST telescope will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of this smallest scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon in the lower solar atmosphere.",

In penumbral filament heads (FH), upflows are observed that turn into the horizontal Evershed flow with increasing distance from the spot center and inclined magnetic fields are observed. In the umbra, however, magnetic fields are more vertical and stronger and convection is reduced. One exception are upflows observed in peripheral umbral dots (PUDs), that appear close to the penumbra/umbra boundary. Due to the limits in the spatial resolution of current solar telescopes, both PUDs and FHs could only just be resolved. With the outstanding spatial resolution of DKIST data, we want to study the substructure of PUDs and FHs. One aim is to investigate whether they are more elongated in larger sunspots, where the magnetic field at the penumbra/umbra boundary is more inclined. Another aim is to study the transition of a FH into a PUD. We want to follow the evolution of the magnetic field vector and velocity during this transition from one fundamental domain into the other and whether the vertical component of the magnetic field plays a major role. Additionally, we want to examine whether there is a response to this transition in atmospheric parameters of chromospheric layers. This could be similar to penumbra microjets, where magnetic reconnection is believed to either release mass flows or shock fronts.",

By designing our experiment  to obtain strictly simultaneous spectra CaII H and 854.2 nm and FeI 630 with the three arms of the ViSP and in the blue continuum with VBI we optimize the retrieval of physical parameters. Observed spectra will be compared with forward modeling from state-of-the-art simulations that include chromospheric physics and retrieved physical quantities will be compared to those in the simulation, to judge the realism of the modeling. Our requested spatial resolution undersamples the DKIST theroretical PSF to strike an optimal balance between polarimetric sensitivity and spatial resolution.",

In this research project, we address the penumbral mode of radiative magnetoconvection. We want to infer the physical fine-structure of a penumbral filament as it forms and evolves in a sunspot. As it is known that a penumbra harbors two field 'components', one that is more vertical ('spines') and one that is more horizontal ('intra-spines'), we aim to investigate the interplay between these two components as a magnetoconvective cell, which constitutes a filament, evolves. We aim to infer the time-dependent topology of the magnetic field, as well as the flow field. Magnetic reconnection, previously observed as chromospheric micro-jets, could be a process that is relevant during the filament evolution.\n\nOur observing program consists of a time series of ViSP scans with a time cadence of less than 3 minutes, in which the slit is aligned to the filaments. ViSP records 3 spectral regions simultaneously. VBI Blue imaging in the blue continuum will allow to study the small-scale evolution of the filaments.\n\nWe will analyze the data with sophisticated inversion techniques and compare our results with synthetic maps of corresponding numerical simulations.\n",

Ellerman bombs are a small-scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon observed in the lower solar atmosphere. Ellerman bombs appear both in the magnetically active solar regions as well as in quiet Sun. Recent observations suggest that Ellerman bombs are ubiquitous and nearly uniformly distributed throughout the solar surface; at a given time, as many as half a million Ellerman bombs could be present on the solar surface. In the second half of the last decade, remarkable advances have been made in our understanding of Ellerman bombs thanks to the high-resolution observational facilities and state-of-the-art MHD simulations. However, there are several fundamental questions remain to be answered regarding the origin, formation, and magnetic field topology of Ellerman bombs. Given the ubiquitous nature, It will be of great interest to study the origin of quiet Sun Ellerman bombs and explore their role in chromospheric and coronal heating. With high spatial and spectral resolution observations with unprecedented polarimetric accuracy, 4m DKIST telescope will be instrumental in advancing our understanding of this smallest scale magnetic reconnection phenomenon in the lower solar atmosphere.",

        "experimentDescription": "Sunspot penumbral jets are dynamic small scale events, seen in the chromosphere. Penumbral jets are ubiquitous. Their formation mechanism is not fully understood. PJs were proposed to form from component (acute angle) reconnection of the magnetic field in spines with that in interspines and were proposed to contribute to transition-region and coronal heating above sunspots. In a recent investigation, it is proposed that penumbral jets form as a result of reconnection between the opposite polarity field at edges of filaments with spine field, and it is found that most of these jets do not significantly directly heat the corona above sunspots, but could indirectly drive coronal heating via generation of MHD waves or braiding of the magnetic field. However, there exist larger jets, repeatedly forming at tails of penumbral filaments, which directly display their signature in coronal wavelengths. Some of the larger penumbral jets are also found to show twisting motion. By using DKIST unprecedented resolution data we propose to investigate the formation mechanism of penumbral jets, and twisting in them. ",

        "experimentDescription": "Sunspots play an outstanding role in astrophysical research, since they provide a direct observation of the energy transport in magnetized plasma, at all their characteristic scales, and in different magnetic environments: strong vertical fields in umbra, weaker more horizontal fields in penumbra. In this research project, we address the penumbral mode of radiative magnetoconvection. We want to infer the physical fine-structure of a penumbral filament as it forms and evolves in a sunspot. As it is known that a penumbra harbors two field 'components', one that is more vertical ('spines') and one that is more horizontal ('intra-spines'), we aim to investigate the interplay between these two components as a magnetoconvective cell, which constitutes a filament, evolves. We aim to infer the time-dependent topology of the magnetic field, as well as the flow field. Magnetic reconnection, previously observed as chromospheric micro-jets, could be a process that is relevant during the filament evolution.\n\nOur observing program consists of a time series of ViSP scans with a time cadence of less than 3 minutes, in which the slit is aligned to the filaments. ViSP records 3 spectral regions simultaneously. VBI Blue imaging in the blue continuum will allow to study the small-scale evolution of the filaments.\n\nWe will analyze the data with sophisticated inversion techniques and compare our results with synthetic maps of corresponding numerical simulations.\n",

        "experimentDescription": "The strongest magnetic fields on the solar surface were long thought to be associated with the umbrae of large sunspots. Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae. DKIST observations will also help to understand the basic plasma physical processes required to amplify the fields to these high strengths and clarify their relevance for the stability and evolution of sunspot penumbrae that harbor SMFs.",

Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae. DKIST observations will also help to understand the basic plasma physical processes required to amplify the fields to these high strengths and clarify their relevance for the stability and evolution of sunspot penumbrae that harbor SMFs.",

The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae.

        "experimentDescription": "The strongest magnetic fields on the solar surface were long thought to be associated with the umbrae of large sunspots. Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae. DKIST observations will also help to understand the basic plasma physical processes required to amplify the fields to these high strengths and clarify their relevance for the stability and evolution of sunspot penumbrae that harbor SMFs.",

        "experimentDescription": "Delta-sunspots, where umbrae with opposite magnetic polarity are contained within a common penumbra, are highly interesting and important magnetic configurations within active regions.  Regions with delta-sunspots are responsible for producing the majority of strong flares.  The polarity inversion line in these sunspots are the sites of unusual, long-lasting behavior: stretched penumbral filaments with strong upflows and downflows, magnetic fields parallel to the solar surface exceeding the umbral magnetic field in strength, and complicated spectral line profiles that hint at multiple components.  The aim of this proposal is to obtain DKIST observations of a delta-sunspot polarity inversion line using multi-height diagnostics of the plasma velocity and magnetic field at high spatial resolution.  DKIST is the only facility capable of carrying out simultaneous observations of plasma diagnostics that span from the deep photosphere (Fe I 1565 nm), through the temperature minimum (Na I D 589.6 nm) and chromosphere (H-beta 486.1 nm, Ca II 854.2 nm), to the transition region (He I 1083.0 nm).  These observations will be used to determine the topology of the magnetic field, how the flows along the polarity inversion line are connected through the atmosphere, and if the complex line profiles are due to structure that was previously unresolved by other instruments or if it is due to multiple structures along the same line of sight.",

Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae. DKIST observations will also help to understand the basic plasma physical processes required to amplify the fields to these high strengths and clarify their relevance for the stability and evolution of sunspot penumbrae that harbor SMFs.",

We propose to use DKIST observations to study the fine-scale magnetic field and electric current systems in AR plage regions, which are important for many dynamic phenomena, and may hold the key to the coronal heating problem. DKIST\\u2019s high spatial resolution, high polarimetry sensitivity, and multi-line observations will allow us to attack three specific scientific goals. First, we will search for the under-reported minority-polarity magnetic flux patches. Second, we will characterize layers of intensified electric current density and their potential correlation with small-scale energetic events. Third, we will assess the vector electric current and Lorentz force density using novel data analysis methods.",

Our target is the magnetic flux cancellation events at granular scales and smaller in the network region at the disk center. We will investigate the dynamics of the horizontal magnetic fields connecting the canceling opposite polarity magnetic elements in the photosphere and chromosphere by the multi-wavelength spectropolarimetric measurements with ViSP and DL-NIRSP. Such study allows us to understand whether the submergence or emergence of magnetic field lines takes place at the magnetic flux cancellation sites.

        "experimentDescription": "The strongest magnetic fields on the solar surface were long thought to be associated with the umbrae of large sunspots. Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae. DKIST observations will also help to understand the basic plasma physical processes required to amplify the fields to these high strengths and clarify their relevance for the stability and evolution of sunspot penumbrae that harbor SMFs.",

        "experimentDescription": "The strongest magnetic fields on the solar surface were long thought to be associated with the umbrae of large sunspots. Thanks to the advances in instrumentation and inversion techniques, observers have recently reported even stronger magnetic fields outside the umbra, at the endpoints of coalescing penumbral filaments close to the outer boundary of a sunspot. At these locations, strong magnetic field concentrations (SMFs) with strengths larger than 7 kG were found. SMFs are accompanied by supersonic downflows reaching speeds of 20 km/s and more. The presence of such strong fields is still highly controversial: They were only detected in the deepest layers of the solar atmosphere by using a newly developed technique to infer the magnetic field strengths from observations by Hinode. The spatial resolution of those observations was barely sufficient to resolve the fine structure within these 1 Mm-sized features. The high spatial resolution of DKIST and the possibility to perform multi-line observations to access a larger height range in the solar photosphere offer a unique opportunity to unambiguously confirm the existence of SMFs, and study their properties. Once confirmed, the DKIST observations could lead to a change in one of the most fundamental taxonomic aspects of sunspots, which is that their strongest magnetic fields at the surface appear situated within their umbrae. DKIST observations will also help to understand the basic plasma physical processes required to amplify the fields to these high strengths and clarify their relevance for the stability and evolution of sunspot penumbrae that harbor SMFs.",

High-cadence imaging with VBI will be used to identify the white-light kernels and to compare/contrast the evolution and structure of the kernels at an unprecedented spatial resolution.  We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.  Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  The ViSP polarimetry of the continuum near Fe I will be used in a novel search for nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a population of ultra-relativistic electrons.  \n",

The six remote sensing and four in situ instruments on board Solar Orbiter provide high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere and measure the plasma properties at the satellite. The Solar Orbiter observations allow for the study of the connection between the Sun and the heliosphere. On 13 October 2022, the Solar Orbiter will reach its perihelion 0.32 AU, and on 16 October, it will be in quadrature with Earth with respect to the Sun. As Solar Orbiter moves closer to the Sun-Earth line, we propose to co-observe a single active region with DKIST over multiple days. This will allow us to simultaneously collect some of the highest spatial resolution photospheric, chromospheric (both with the VBI at DKIST), and coronal (with the EUI onboard Solar Orbiter) imaging ever sampled. On top of this, high-resolution spectropolarimetric data sampled by the ViSP and the SPICE instruments will provide context about the local magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in exquisite detail. Such co-observations will return open-source datasets that will allow researchers to understand better the evolution of active regions (which are, of course, extremely important as the predominant locations where space weather events are driven from) and to probe the flows of mass and energy between different atmospheric layers in unprecedented detail.

        "experimentDescription": "Solar Orbiter is an ESA/NASA's Sun orbiting mission that was launched in February 2020. The nominal science phase of the mission started in November 2021. The six remote sensing and four in situ instruments on board Solar Orbiter provide high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere and measure the plasma properties at the satellite. The Solar Orbiter observations allow for the study of the connection between the Sun and the heliosphere. On 13 October 2022, the Solar Orbiter will reach its perihelion 0.32 AU, and on 16 October, it will be in quadrature with Earth with respect to the Sun. As Solar Orbiter moves closer to the Sun-Earth line, we propose to co-observe a single active region with DKIST over multiple days. This will allow us to simultaneously collect some of the highest spatial resolution photospheric, chromospheric (both with the VBI at DKIST), and coronal (with the EUI onboard Solar Orbiter) imaging ever sampled. On top of this, high-resolution spectropolarimetric data sampled by the ViSP and the SPICE instruments will provide context about the local magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in exquisite detail. Such co-observations will return open-source datasets that will allow researchers to understand better the evolution of active regions (which are, of course, extremely important as the predominant locations where space weather events are driven from) and to probe the flows of mass and energy between different atmospheric layers in unprecedented detail. We propose that these datasets be sampled over 2-3 days, between the 22nd and 27th October 2022.",

Their connection with the photospheric magnetic field is still unclear. Taking advantage of the DKIST's unprecedented high sensitivity polarimetry and spatial resolution, we propose to observe part of a filament, including filament barbs to address the connection question. We will use the ViSP to infer the photospheric magnetic field vector below filament barbs, and use the VBI to study the motions and oscillations of filament fine structures. We use the synoptic filament observing program of the DST to make observations of the same filament. Coordination on the DKIST side is not required, and notification of target position immediately after the DKIST observation or earlier is preferred. Combined DKIST and DST observations provide us opportunities to investigate filaments over time-scales comparable to their lifetimes.",

We use the synoptic filament observing program of the DST to make observations of the same filament.

        "experimentDescription": "Filaments are dense plasma structures, suspended above photospheric magnetic polarity inversion lines, and their threads are along magnetic field lines. Their connection with the photospheric magnetic field is still unclear. Taking advantage of the DKIST's unprecedented high sensitivity polarimetry and spatial resolution, we propose to observe part of a filament, including filament barbs to address the connection question. We will use the ViSP to infer the photospheric magnetic field vector below filament barbs, and use the VBI to study the motions and oscillations of filament fine structures. We use the synoptic filament observing program of the DST to make observations of the same filament. Coordination on the DKIST side is not required, and notification of target position immediately after the DKIST observation or earlier is preferred. Combined DKIST and DST observations provide us opportunities to investigate filaments over time-scales comparable to their lifetimes.",

Kotani & Shibata (2020) performed 3D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection with solar photospheric parameters and showed that jet-like structures were induced by reconnection in the solar photosphere. We also pointed out that MHD waves generated by photospheric anemone jet-like structures could influence the local chromospheric heating and the formation of spicules. However, our numerical simulations did not reveal the statistical nature of the photospheric anemone jet-like structure, as the simulations were performed given typical and expected parameters.

The six remote sensing and four in situ instruments on board Solar Orbiter provide high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere and measure the plasma properties at the satellite. The Solar Orbiter observations allow for the study of the connection between the Sun and the heliosphere. On 13 October 2022, the Solar Orbiter will reach its perihelion 0.32 AU, and on 16 October, it will be in quadrature with Earth with respect to the Sun. As Solar Orbiter moves closer to the Sun-Earth line, we propose to co-observe a single active region with DKIST over multiple days. This will allow us to simultaneously collect some of the highest spatial resolution photospheric, chromospheric (both with the VBI at DKIST), and coronal (with the EUI onboard Solar Orbiter) imaging ever sampled. On top of this, high-resolution spectropolarimetric data sampled by the ViSP and the SPICE instruments will provide context about the local magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in exquisite detail. Such co-observations will return open-source datasets that will allow researchers to understand better the evolution of active regions (which are, of course, extremely important as the predominant locations where space weather events are driven from) and to probe the flows of mass and energy between different atmospheric layers in unprecedented detail.

High-cadence imaging with VBI will be used to identify the white-light kernels and to compare/contrast the evolution and structure of the kernels at an unprecedented spatial resolution.  We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.  Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  The ViSP polarimetry of the continuum near Fe I will be used in a novel search for nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a population of ultra-relativistic electrons.  \n",

We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.

The six remote sensing and four in situ instruments on board Solar Orbiter provide high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere and measure the plasma properties at the satellite. The Solar Orbiter observations allow for the study of the connection between the Sun and the heliosphere. On 13 October 2022, the Solar Orbiter will reach its perihelion 0.32 AU, and on 16 October, it will be in quadrature with Earth with respect to the Sun. As Solar Orbiter moves closer to the Sun-Earth line, we propose to co-observe a single active region with DKIST over multiple days. This will allow us to simultaneously collect some of the highest spatial resolution photospheric, chromospheric (both with the VBI at DKIST), and coronal (with the EUI onboard Solar Orbiter) imaging ever sampled. On top of this, high-resolution spectropolarimetric data sampled by the ViSP and the SPICE instruments will provide context about the local magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in exquisite detail. Such co-observations will return open-source datasets that will allow researchers to understand better the evolution of active regions (which are, of course, extremely important as the predominant locations where space weather events are driven from) and to probe the flows of mass and energy between different atmospheric layers in unprecedented detail. We propose that these datasets be sampled over 2-3 days, between the 22nd and 27th October 2022.",

Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  The ViSP polarimetry of the continuum near Fe I will be used in a novel search for nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a population of ultra-relativistic electrons.  \n",

These jets are formed as a consequence of magnetic reconnection, and from the scale universality of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), it can be expected that anemone jets exist even in the solar photosphere. Kotani & Shibata (2020) performed 3D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection with solar photospheric parameters and showed that jet-like structures were induced by reconnection in the solar photosphere. We also pointed out that MHD waves generated by photospheric anemone jet-like structures could influence the local chromospheric heating and the formation of spicules. However, our numerical simulations did not reveal the statistical nature of the photospheric anemone jet-like structure, as the simulations were performed given typical and expected parameters. We propose to detect the anemone jet-like structures with their length of approximately 100 km in the photosphere for the first time and to investigate their statistical properties and their effects on chromospheric heating and spicule formation through the high-resolution DKIST observations of photosphere and chromosphere.",

        "experimentDescription": "Extreme fine structuring in the chromospheric umbra is largely unstudied and poorly understood. It consists of both small-scale umbral microjets and dark thin fibrils that are revealed during umbral flashes. First observed by Socas-Navarro (2009), precise semi-empirical modelling of these features is instrumentally limited. Both microjets, other brightenings and fibrils are visible that are not synchronous with umbral flashes (Bharti et al. 2013, Nelson et al. 2017). The accuracy of inversion schemes in the highly dynamic umbra when using wavelength scanning instruments (Felipe et al., 2018) is limited. Still, insight using inversion schemes is possible and has revealed that phase differences in the flow fields, secondary to acoustic wave steepening, plays a role in the joint formation of both bright and dark structures (Henriques et al. 2020). However, what quantity exactly causes the dark components to be visible at all is an open problem and the literature disagrees on the nature of the small-scale brightenings and on the atmospheric models behind umbral flashes themselves. Multi-line spectra at DKIST allow for a resolution of the exiting degeneracies at sufficiently fast acquisition times that overcome the limitations identified by Felipe et al. (2018), not to mention sufficient resolution as necessary to these sub-arcsecond structures. This proposal provides an observation strategy to achieve semi-empirical modelling success and allows a scientific answer to the nature of umbral chomospheric fine structure. Understanding such fine structures also provides a new ultra-local window into the conditions of the umbral chromosphere.",

High-cadence imaging with VBI will be used to identify the white-light kernels and to compare/contrast the evolution and structure of the kernels at an unprecedented spatial resolution.  We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.  Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  The ViSP polarimetry of the continuum near Fe I will be used in a novel search for nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a population of ultra-relativistic electrons.  \n",

High-cadence imaging with VBI will be used to identify the white-light kernels and to compare/contrast the evolution and structure of the kernels at an unprecedented spatial resolution.  We will determine whether the narrow Ca II H and broad hydrogen epsilon lines occur at different locations and times within the flaring area.  These high resolution spectra will provide much-needed constraints on the current modeling approach for stellar flares.   We will compare model spectra calculated from a new semi-empirical flare modeling code to determine the electron charge density and optical depth in chromospheric condensations.  Then, the ViSP spectra will be used to test the detailed time evolution of the pressure broadening of hydrogen predicted in RADYN/RH simulations of high-flux electron beam heating.  The ViSP polarimetry of the continuum near Fe I will be used in a novel search for nonthermal synchrotron radiation from a population of ultra-relativistic electrons.  \n",

The polar fields are composed of facular concentrations of about 5 arcsec in size, often with field strengths exceeding a kilogauss, but the mean overall flux density is only of order 5-10 gauss. The polar fields are mostly radially directed and are mostly unipolar, but viewed from the ecliptic these mostly weak fields must be observed mostly in the transverse component. It is well known that the Zeeman effect for the transverse component is an order of magnitude less sensitive than for the longitudinal component. Existing measurements of the polar field have therefore lacked the polarimetric sensitivity and spatial resolution to capture all polar magnetic field structures.  The unique 4m and all-reflective design of DKIST provides an unparalleled opportunity to resolve the smallest and weakest magnetic structures with high-SNR full-Stokes spectro-polarimetry. In addition, the IR lines observed by DL-NIRSP have sensitivities to LOS fields twice that of visible lines, and four times higher for transverse fields, besides smaller image disturbances from the Earth’s atmosphere. We propose to observe the polar fields using DKIST's ViSP and DL-NIRSP spectra-polarimeters, and the VBI. Reliable polar field measurements would enable us to measure polar flux distributions reliably and comprehensively, including small, weak structures, leading to improved global coronal field models that are central to solar physics and space weather research and operations projects.",

        "experimentDescription": "Extreme fine structuring in the chromospheric umbra is largely unstudied and poorly understood. It consists of both small-scale umbral microjets and dark thin fibrils that are revealed during umbral flashes. First observed by Socas-Navarro (2009), precise semi-empirical modelling of these features is instrumentally limited. Both microjets, other brightenings and fibrils are visible that are not synchronous with umbral flashes (Bharti et al. 2013, Nelson et al. 2017). The accuracy of inversion schemes in the highly dynamic umbra when using wavelength scanning instruments (Felipe et al., 2018) is limited. Still, insight using inversion schemes is possible and has revealed that phase differences in the flow fields, secondary to acoustic wave steepening, plays a role in the joint formation of both bright and dark structures (Henriques et al. 2020). However, what quantity exactly causes the dark components to be visible at all is an open problem and the literature disagrees on the nature of the small-scale brightenings and on the atmospheric models behind umbral flashes themselves. Multi-line spectra at DKIST allow for a resolution of the exiting degeneracies at sufficiently fast acquisition times that overcome the limitations identified by Felipe et al. (2018), not to mention sufficient resolution as necessary to these sub-arcsecond structures. This proposal provides an observation strategy to achieve semi-empirical modelling success and allows a scientific answer to the nature of umbral chomospheric fine structure. Understanding such fine structures also provides a new ultra-local window into the conditions of the umbral chromosphere.",

There are have been many proposed theoretical explanations for the origin of the heating, but none have satisfactory observational constraints. One of the most prominent candidates for chromospheric heating is the dissipation of high-frequency waves driven from the convective overshoot at the base of the photosphere. Recent work has provided evidence in both directions, as authors disagree if high-frequency waves could provide the required energy flux to sustain the quiescent chromosphere. We propose observational program with DKIST that could provide better observational limits to the high-frequency flux carried in the chromosphere. Furthermore, the polarimetric capabilities of DKIST could provide us with the first observational estimate of the role of the magnetic field in the propagation and dissipation of waves in the lower solar atmosphere.",

The goal of the project is to investigate the AR magnetic structure, in particular determine photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields and plasma temperatures at different heights, as well as compute energy and current-related characteristics (vertical currents, amount of the magnetic shear, vertical Poynting flux). To determine the physical parameters, we will employ state-of-the art multi-line inversion codes. The inferred magnetic field vector maps at multiple heights will be used to derive physical properties of the AR. We will also compare the inferred photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields and related derived quantities to modeled coronal values from data-driven numerical simulations.",

The goal of the project is to investigate the AR magnetic structure, in particular determine photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields and plasma temperatures at different heights, as well as compute energy and current-related characteristics (vertical currents, amount of the magnetic shear, vertical Poynting flux). To determine the physical parameters, we will employ state-of-the art multi-line inversion codes. The inferred magnetic field vector maps at multiple heights will be used to derive physical properties of the AR. We will also compare the inferred photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields and related derived quantities to modeled coronal values from data-driven numerical simulations.",

        "experimentDescription": "The solar chromosphere is dominated by radiative losses, which are a few kW/m^2 larger than the sum of all of its heating sources. There are have been many proposed theoretical explanations for the origin of the heating, but none have satisfactory observational constraints. One of the most prominent candidates for chromospheric heating is the dissipation of high-frequency waves driven from the convective overshoot at the base of the photosphere. Recent work has provided evidence in both directions, as authors disagree if high-frequency waves could provide the required energy flux to sustain the quiescent chromosphere. We propose observational program with DKIST that could provide better observational limits to the high-frequency flux carried in the chromosphere. Furthermore, the polarimetric capabilities of DKIST could provide us with the first observational estimate of the role of the magnetic field in the propagation and dissipation of waves in the lower solar atmosphere.",

We also study how the surrounding convective motions affect the difference between the flux cancellations caused by the submergence and emergence of magnetic field lines from the comparison with the flow patterns derived from the G-band images with VBI. The flux removal process at the flux cancellation site is not yet spatially resolved even by the recent state-of-the-art instruments. The large aperture of DKIST, combined with a unique suite of instruments, allows to acquire for the first time high spatial and temporal data with the high spectropolarimetric sensitivity necessary to resolve the long-standing question of the dynamic nature of the flux cancellation process.

The flux removal process at the flux cancellation site is not yet spatially resolved even by the recent state-of-the-art instruments. The large aperture of DKIST, combined with a unique suite of instruments, allows to acquire for the first time high spatial and temporal data with the high spectropolarimetric sensitivity necessary to resolve the long-standing question of the dynamic nature of the flux cancellation process.
